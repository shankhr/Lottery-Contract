# Lottery-Contract
Created a lottery contract to simulate a simple lottery with Ethereum along with an interactive front-end web application.

# Working of Lottery
In this lottery, users can enter as players through their MetaMask Ethereum accounts by paying a certain amount of Ether.
There exists a manager who manages the lottery and picks a winner when required.
When the winner is picked at random, the Ether prize pool collected is transferred to that user and the lottery is reset.

# Implementation
The Solidity compiler was used to compile the contract and it was then deployed into the network.
The Rinkeby Ethereum Test Network has been used for the purpose of implementing this lottery.
React was used to create an interactive front-end web application for users to experience the lottery.
